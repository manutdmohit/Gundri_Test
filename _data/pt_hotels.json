    "hotel_desc": "<p>Are there any places where I feel like I am home? This question haunts every traveler who visits Nepal. The simple answer is hotels are ubiquitous. There are hotels with varied styles ranging from flashy mega-hotels to bare-bones youth hostels available in the Country. Your never-ending search for something &ldquo;new and different&rdquo; ends in Salwood Heritage, the Best Boutique Hotel that is situated in the peaceful area of Buddha Tole Marg of Bahati Pokhari in the Vicinity of the Tourist Hub, Thamel but away from the throng of the tourists and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will definitely feel an intimate atmosphere as well as an idiosyncratic style of your choice. We offer personalized attention and styled accommodations for your homely stay in Kathmandu. We make you feel the ambiance of being a personal guest in a private home, rather than just a hotel occupant and we offer an opportunity of communal &ldquo;living spaces&rdquo; where guests can interact. Once you enter the hotel, you will feel a distinctive vibe as well as unique and purely traditional Nepalese architecture and interior design combined with historic details and artistic amalgamation. Our rooms are individually decorated using upscale linens and exclusive amenities.

Local craftspeople from Patan and Bungamati have handcrafted every detail in the building, from the dark wood carved beams to the bronze fixtures in the lobby to the decorative tile-work in the bathrooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although understated in its elegance, Traditional Comfort contains many intricate, surprising details for curious guests: angled ankhi-jyaal windows that cast geometric shadows; scenes of local life hand-painted directly onto the walls. At Traditional Comfort you will be surrounded by the fusion of ancient traditions and a modern capital city. We believe in the power of sustainable tourism. As well as employing local artisans in the design and construction of the hotel, we employ responsible environmental practices.</p>",

This is an interesting new concept and I have been reading the stories with interest.&nbsp; We run the clean and tidy room&nbsp; in our small town and sometimes we do struggle to be fully occupied because people like to choose the cheaper hotel and I do believe that the perception of our town is that it should be &lsquo;cheap&rsquo;.&nbsp; My dilemma is that I don&rsquo;t feel that I should drop my prices to match these lower standard properties when in reality people who come to stay with us get better value for money because of all the extras we do offer eg: breakfast, excellent quality bedding and furnishings, personal service etc.&nbsp; All of these things are reflected in our excellent ratings and client feedback. we have excellent ranking but what are peoples thoughts on how to differentiate between us and the other ?&nbsp; I do think that clients have all of this information at their fingertips through the Booking photos/description pages but whether or not they choose to step away from what they are used to? made for only for the stay so that guest can get good room with low price with&nbsp; high quality bed sit</p>",

Bandipur- once a prosperous center of trade between lowland and highland, between British India and Tibet is located at a distance of 130kms (4hrs) from Kathmandu, 70kms (2hrs) from Pokhara, and 50kms (1.5hrs) from Chitwan. 50yrs of time-warp imposed by &lsquo;progress&rsquo; had all but passed it by (along with the new valley-based road system); and only now reached by a rough, winding, climbing motorable track. Old bazaar, little temples to a dozen different deities, lazy walks through idyllic farms, and orange groves. Tumbling watercourses, natural springs, outlying villages of many different ethnic groups, and huge spreading banyan and pipal trees where porters rest their loads. And the endless views to North, South, East, and West.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Old Inn, located in the heart of the old bazaar, is a fine example of traditional Newari architecture. Its four stories of atmospheric living quarters are built entirely of timber and warm red brick. Carved beams and staircases, balconies, south-facing verandah, and north-facing terrace and add to that, our new wing facing the entire length of the&nbsp;&lsquo;pedestrian&nbsp;only&rsquo;&nbsp;bazaar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food is mainly rustic Nepali style - simple, delicious, and prepared entirely from locally-sourced organic ingredients<strong>.</strong></p>",

With beautiful panoramic views of the Himalayas (Everest on clear days!), Double Rainbow offers training and knowledge for organic farming, yoga/meditation, chanting, jungle treks, and a natural homestay to relax and rejuvenate. Additionally, Krishna still offers his services as a trekking guide, which he has done for the last 30 years!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have countless varieties of grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, jams, candies, wine, and chutneys that are all grown organically and made here at the farm,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We make our own organic compost fertilizer, organic pesticide, and organic tonic (to help weak plants).

Located 165 km away from the busy capital Kathmandu, Chitwan National Park is home to more than 50 species of mammals like inimitable one-horned rhinos, sloth bears, enormous elephants, leopards, bison, crocodiles, pythons, and 530 colorful singing birds. Exotic birds such as giant hornbills, lesser floricans, and paradise flycatchers can also be observed.

The national park located in the far western district of Bardia is bordered by River Karnali in the west, the Churia range in the north, while the river Babai flows right through the park and it occupies the Siwaliks range with the highest peak of Sukarmala (1441m). The varied geographical factors together with the cover of Salm Savannah forests and grasslands render this region ideal as a wild animal habitat. The park hosts 30 different mammals, more than 250 species of birds, and several varieties of reptiles and water animals. Some of the water animals found there are elephants, swamp deer, blackbuck, gharial crocodile, and marsh mugger crocodile. The exotic Gangetic dolphin is sometimes of Bengal florican, lesser florican, silver-earned mesia and sarus crane. The park offers the rare opportunity of fishing at River Karnali and River Babai.<img src=\"http://jungleheaven.com.np/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/BardiaNationalPark-Map.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:294px; width:588px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best time to visit the Bardia ark is autumn, winter, and early summer when the weather is warm and dry. From April through June, the temperature rises up reaching 45 degrees centigrade in May. The hot sticky days give way to the monsoon rains that last till September. Bardia consists of three major natural forests from the riverine composition of Khair-sissoo, to sal in the Terai and hills, and to Chir pine-oak in the Siwaliks. Of the recorded 173 species, sal is the dominant species.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best way to reach the national Park is via Nepalgunj in Banke district. Nepalgunj is connected by air and by road to the capital and other cities in the west. The Park&#39;s headquarters Thakurdwara is approximately an hour&#39;s drive away from the Nepalgunj-Surkhet road. Another option to reach the Park is from Birendranagar in Surkhet district which is also connected by air to Kathmandu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the surrounding areas of the National Park, tourists can also experience white-water rafting in the longest river of Nepal-Karnali. One may even spot dolphins or gharial in the river. The river was recently marked seventh place in the white-water rafting category.</p>",

With rapid urbanization in Nepal came alarming destruction of old traditional buildings and replaced by concrete structures as owners think old buildings are difficult to keep and don&rsquo;t&nbsp; have economic values. In the late Nineties UNESCO world heritage center in coordination with Patan tourism board sponsored the renovation work of Newa Chen to restore it to its 17th&nbsp;century glory combined with modern amenities for tourist accommodation. The renovation work officially called &ldquo;Shrestha house pilot project&rdquo; has following goals;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>To Preserve Newa Chen building for its important architectural and historical value,</li>\r\n\t<li>To turn Newa Chen as a model tourist accommodation to promote sustainable heritage preservation drive in Nepal.</li>\r\n\t<li>&nbsp;to stop rampant destruction of privately owned old traditional houses with effective message that old houses can be remodeled and turn into nice habitable place for modern living to create financial benefits.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The renovation of Newa Chen was carefully done with passion and respect for traditional looks and values with extensive use and reuse of local materials, knowhow and skills of local crafts men with guidance of Heritage experts and creative people. It retained its original structures, dimensions, low ceiling and cosy characters of authentic traditional Newari house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Newa Chen, Melissa Jenkins a heritage expert says, &ldquo;It is difficult to overstate how appealing it is for foreign visitors to stay in an authentic traditional house if it combines the culture experience with the benefits of modern facilities&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Lonely Planet Newa Chen is fittingly described as &ldquo;housed inside the UNESCO restored mansion, this place is more traditional than most and offers a window onto what it must have been like to be a well-to- do resident of Patan in centuries past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newa Chen is ancestral property of Hyamo&rsquo;s (Shrestha&rsquo;s ), descendent of indigenous Newar community of Kathmandu valley. The Hyamos were prestigious and affluent family of Patan in the past with background of trade link with Lhasa (Tibet). &nbsp;Newa Chen was built in the medieval Malla king dynasty period (1200-1768 A.D.) an era marked by unprecedented boom in trade, culture and architecture in Kathmandu valley. Today in Nepal, Newa Chen is an exemplary first of its kind family run authentic traditional tourist accommodation which is popular among heritage lovers, dignitaries, news papers and media. Newa Chen established a good example of how heritage can to be preserved and sustained by creating its economic values.&nbsp; We Newa Chen family feels great joy to welcome heritage lovers from around the world to stay with us for an enjoyable experience of authentic traditional living in Newari family. Thank you so much</p>",

In still others, it is a private home which has been converted for the exclusive use of guest accommodation. The owner usually lives in an entirely separate area within the property and the guest house may serve as a form of lodging business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>n some areas of the world, guest houses are the only kind of accommodation available for visitors who have no local relatives to stay with. Among the features which distinguish a guest house from a hotel, or inn is the lack of a full-time staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bed and breakfasts and guest houses in England are family owned and live on the premises though family members are not normally available during the evening. However most family members work a 10 to 12 hour day from 6am as they may employ part-time service staff. Hotels maintain a staff presence 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, whereas a guest house has a more limited staff presence. Because of limited staff presence, check in at a guest house is often by appointment. An inn also usually has a restaurant attached.</p>",

    "hotel_slug": "Nirvana-Home",
    "hotel_desc": "<p>Exploring the city of Kathmandu is an adventure, where one discovers pockets that offer quiet and solitude from the manic haste of the main thoroughfares. Venture outside of the Ring Road, the network that encircles the city limits, and your eyes will slowly see the concrete structures fading away into greenery and pastures that are soothing to the eyes. Kathmandu is also dotted with thousands of deities, some ensconced within grand structures, some in places less stately, but all bearing testimony to the spiritual bent of the Nepali heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a guest, to this city encircled by gently rising hills, one can find sanctuary in Nirvana Home, which is set within the peaceful environs of Salla Ghari, Maharajgunj, on the way to the famous Budanilkantha, where the deity of the reclining Vishnu is a majestic sight. Only a 30-minute drive from Tribhuwan International Airport, Nirvana Home is a newly built property providing guests with a retreat that feels like the extension of one&rsquo;s home. Peace and quiet are guaranteed in this residence-only area. The spacious lobby leads one to a flight of stairs that takes guests to the living quarters. 12 well-appointed rooms wait to be discovered, each very individual in character. Much thought has been put into the d&eacute;cor, which is apparent when you see the wallpapers matching the flooring, furnishing, and upholstery, reflecting a soothing play of colors. The spacious and luxurious rooms have all the essentials one would expect to find at a modern establishment, yet they manage to exude a sense of living in a home. The traditional warmth of Nepali hospitality mixed with a fine balance of Western-influenced unobtrusive service is apparent throughout. Each floor and each room are individual yet feel a part of a wholesome experience &ndash; that is quiet, tranquil, and relaxing to the senses. The balconies open onto a relaxing private space intensifying the homely feel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guests can choose to walk up to the rooftop where one is treated to 360 degree views of the valley and with the weather favoring, spectacular sceneries of snow-capped mountain ranges to the north, west, and east. In the spring and summer this is a great space to relax with a drink in hand and watch the sunset. One can also make use of the sauna (dry) which is on the same floor. Just below the rooftop is a vast balcony which also houses a glass-enclosed Jacuzzi, offering an intimate atmosphere yet seemingly open to the elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spacious, tree-ensconced garden is a wonderful place to sit and relax, where one can choose to have breakfast or while away a lazy afternoon with a book in hand. The garden also has a clean 34&rsquo;X20&rsquo; family-friendly swimming pool and guests can always opt for a dip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Embassies of several countries (Thailand, Australia, USA, Pakistan, Bangladesh) as well as specialty hospitals (Gangalal Heart Hospital, the Teaching Hospital, and the Neuro Hospital) are all within walking distance from the Home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should you choose to venture into the city, guests have a choice of borrowing one of the city-bikes that are on standby, or opt for a pre-requested motorized drop off and pick up. Shop to your heart&rsquo;s content in the amazingly colorful lanes of Thamel, where you can pick up local handicraft and knick-knacks. Thamel is also a gastronomer&rsquo;s delight with the highest concentration of international-quality restaurants than anywhere in Kathmandu. Jostling with pocket-friendly eateries and bars, are places where local bands belt out cover versions of international hits, as well as local tunes. For a concentrated, all-under-one-roof shopping experience, one can visit the Bhatbhateni chain of super stores.</p>",

Situated 7 kilometers above Dumbre Bazaar and three hours drive from Kathmandu at an altitude of 1,005 meters, this ancient trading post lies cradled in the saddle of some of the country&#39;s most peculiar-shaped hills. Untouched by modernization, and laced with an abundance of ancient houses, temples of great significance, and historical architecture, this medieval-era town boasts of festivals all year around besides offering a plethora of cultures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The neighboring villages with majority population of Magars, Gurungs, Bahuns, Chhetris, Damais and Sarkis contribute to the cultural diversity of the region. The hilltop town not only overlooks the incredible expanse of the Marsyanngdi river valley, but also offers a breathtaking sweep of the Himalayan range, from Langtang in the east to Dhaulagiri in the west. From nearby hilltops, one can see as far as Manakamana and Gorkha to east, and the great Chitwan plains to the south, among others. Once a bustling commercial center along the trade route linking Tibet with British, the town&rsquo;s people heartily welcome travelers from near and far. While the Siddha Gufa (the largest cavern in the country) and Patali Dwar (also known as the Gateway to Heaven) are must-sees, this place also offers endless hiking possibilities in the surrounding hills.</p>",

    "hotel_desc": "<p>Mr. Nirakar Regmi used to travel to different places in the country as a part of his job as a police officer. During his travels, he had to stay in different hotels, often for longer periods. A cheerful and a person who loves to interact with people, he never found a hotel where he could go and talk to the owners and feel like home. When he retired after 18 years of service he was looking to do something to keep himself engaged. He discussed this idea of opening a family run hotel with wife Mrs. Mana Regmi, a social worker and secretary at Lions Club. In 2017, they turned their family property into a hotel in Lainchaur, Kathmandu and named it as &ldquo;Hotel Tranquil&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Accommodation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rooms are divided into three categories; Economy, Standard and Deluxe. The economy rooms have fan, television. The standard rooms have Air Conditioner, Television. The deluxe rooms have Air Conditioner, Television,Fridge and a Mini bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Food</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nepali Khana Set, (rice, lentils, vegetables, meat, pickle &amp; curd) and Momos (Dumplings in Nepali way) are a hit among customers from the menu. The idea behind it according to Mrs. Regmi, who cooks these food herself, is to give a local &amp; homely taste to the guests. The guest can use the Kitchen to cook their own food if they are staying for a longer term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ambiance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The atmosphere at Hotel Tranquil is free from disturbance with peaceful environment and calm nature. From the rooftop one can treat their eyes with magnificent view of the monkey temple in the evening, and refreshing views of Central Nepal Himalayan Range (if the weather is clean) in the morning. Guests can even come down to the lobby to relax, drink and for a beautiful conversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

At an elevation of 900m in the warm heart of these Middle Hills, Nuwakot Bazaar retains a sense of a lofty back-of-beyond, and a sense too of little changing over the centuries; a place where the local saying &lsquo;<em>man believes time passes, time knows man passes&rsquo;</em>&nbsp;clearly resonates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now think of a farm on a terraced hillside, of an ancient fortress and citadel of terracotta tiled roofs and gold finials glinting in the sunshine. Below is a fertile valley, a river meandering through it. The scene is given vast scale by the surrounding great green hills &ndash; yet actually merely foothills &ndash; rising in the north to the snows of The Langtang Himal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That farm, fortress, and citadel are Nuwakot: just a 5km detour, a mid-way gem &hellip;and for how much longer to be barely mentioned by guidebooks? Nuwakot Bazaar is a centerpiece of the Nepalese story; of the shaping of far-flung tribes and of trans-Himalayan races into a unified kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An imposing manor house and two charming cottages form a courtyard, while The Farm itself is a delight of quiet corners and verdant niches with terraces of abundant, colorful, organic crops. Not that it was always so; for with once prosperous families headed to Kathmandu for education and a plastic existence, rot, collapse and subsidence had long been the reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ways and moods of the working farm permeate and the new freshness of the interiors take nothing from their rustic ambiance. There are a total of 14 bedrooms, a dozen or so guests are typical and families thrive.</p>",

The original building of Maya Manor Boutique Hotel was built by Commander in Chief Toran Shumsher Rana and his brother Balram SJB Rana in 1935. The Chinese Ambassador lived in this mansion for 10 years. In 1974, the Sakya Family of the KGH Group of Hotels brought the mansion and was their family home until it was converted into a hotel in 2016.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSituated near the previous Royal Palace, where the ill-fated Royal Massacre occurred on 1 June 2001, the magnificently restored historic Maya Manor stands tall in the city&#39;s commercial hub, showcasing the grandeur of European colonial-influenced architecture which was introduced to Nepal in the 1800s by its Rana rulers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the Maoists insurgency, the Carter Centre played a prominent role in mediating the peace process and opened its office in the southern part of this mansion, which was inaugurated by Jimmy Carter himself in 2008.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe earthquake in 2015 partially damaged the mansion but was meticulously renovated and at the same time, a new block of a seven-storied building with the same old colonial architecture was added to turn it into a hotel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNestled in a manicured neo-classical garden, Maya Manor Boutique Hotel is adorned with a Victorian gazebo, exquisite Rocco works, and wrought-iron verandas. It embodies the idea of a quintessential Victorian-era architecture furnished with antiques, art &amp; artifacts. The regal buttery-yellow property of Maya Manor Boutique Hotel manages to offer a timely and timeless flavor of the elegant past.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe hotel is ideally located just a few footsteps away from the prestigious Durbar Marg, the city&rsquo;s best address for trendy caf&eacute;s and restaurants and other commercial businesses like airlines, banks, department stores, and souvenir shops. Maya Manor Boutique Hotel is a perfect address for businessmen and distinguished travelers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany important national landmarks including Monument Tower, City Clock, Nagpokhari Sacred Pond, Nandakeshari Heritage Courtyard, and Narayanhiti Golden Sprout surround the hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
